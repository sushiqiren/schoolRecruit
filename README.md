# CorpU central online system


A useful web application for university staff recruitment and management, also for applicants applying for jobs.


Managing the hiring process for sessional staff each semester is a complex and time-intensive
process. To help with this, CorpU would like to investigate the use of a central online system.
At a minimum, this system needs to:
• Allow interested people to:
o input their details (contact details, qualifications etc.).
o see a list of units looking for staff.
o nominate their preferences for which classes to teach.
o provide their availability for scheduling purposes.
• Allow permanent staff to:
o view a list of people interested in their unit, including their details (contact details, qualifications etc.), and availability.


Permanent staff or sessional staff can choose their respective login portal to do class management and personal information update. Applicants can login to the portal to apply for jobs they want and sign up to system if they are new to system.
