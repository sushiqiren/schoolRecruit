# CorpU central online system
A useful web application for university staff recruitment and management, also for applicants applying for jobs.
Managing the hiring process for sessional staff each semester is a complex and time-intensive
process. To help with this, CorpU would like to investigate the use of a central online system.
At a minimum, this system needs to:
• Allow interested people to:
o input their details (contact details, qualifications etc.).
o see a list of units looking for staff.
o nominate their preferences for which classes to teach.
o provide their availability for scheduling purposes.
• Allow permanent staff to:
o view a list of people interested in their unit, including their details (contact details, qualifications etc.), and availability.
